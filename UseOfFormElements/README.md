## 📌 Overview

The form collects user information and includes:

- Name & Surname
- E-mail & Password
- Gender (radio buttons)
- Favorite Fruit (dropdown list)

## ✨ Features

- Clean and simple HTML structure
- No CSS files – all styles are added via `style=""` attributes

- Rounded edges and spacing for a smoother look

## 🖼️ Visual Layout Example

| (left side) | (right side) |
+----------------------+----------------------------+

> The image used is named `form.jpg` and should be placed in the same folder as `creating_form.html`.
