## Features
Responsive Design: Seamless viewing on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) thanks to Bootstrap's grid system.

Dark-Themed Navbar: A stylish, dark-colored, and centered design for the heading and navigation menu.

Hero Section (Jumbotron): A wide and prominent section on the homepage introducing the content.

Blog Cards: Bootstrap card components used to display recent blog posts on the homepage.

Grid Layout: A flexible grid system that allows cards to be neatly arranged in 3 columns (on medium and large screens) or a single column (on small screens) across different screen sizes.

Equal Card Height: All blog cards maintain the same height thanks to the h-100 class.

Detailed Post Page: Each blog post is displayed in detail within a single, wide card on the posts.html page.

Contact Form: A responsive contact form created using Bootstrap form components on the contact.html page.

Fixed Footer: A footer that remains fixed at the bottom of the page, visible even when the user scrolls.
