                            Dogs have always been known as loyal and loving companions, but some breeds stand out with their especially friendly nature. 
                            Golden Retrievers, Labradors, and Beagles are among the top choices for families and first-time dog owners. 
                            These breeds are gentle, affectionate, and usually get along well with children and other pets. 
                            Whether you're looking for a playful buddy or a calm cuddle partner, these friendly breeds are sure to warm 
                            your heart.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Beyond their friendly disposition, these breeds are also known for their intelligence and trainability, making them excellent family pets. 
                            They thrive on human companionship and are eager to please, which makes them relatively easy to train. 
                            Regular exercise and mental stimulation are key to keeping them happy and healthy. 
                            Consider adopting from a local shelter or rescue organization to give a loving dog a second chance at a happy life.
